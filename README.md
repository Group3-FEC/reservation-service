# Home2Go's Reservation Service
Home2Go is a vacation home rental application built with service-oriented architecture, and this is the reservation service of the app. The module allows users to reserve a particular home using a calendar that displays available dates.

Users are able to select any range of dates (so long as it satisfies the minimum number of nights required) up to a year in advance. The service also comes with a side-scrolling modal that users will eventually be able to use to view billing information for the dates that have been selected. 

Built with React, CSS, Express, and MongoDB - no third party styling and/or UI frameworks used.
